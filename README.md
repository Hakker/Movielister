# Movielister
The project reads XML files and make a web accessible database of it.

This project is still heavily in progress and sure as hell isn't ready for the open yet :)

what it will do in the end...
- ability to scan your given local/network storage location recursively for xml/nfo based files
- add the contents of the xml file in a relational database
- search movies based by year, actors/actresses, directors, studio
- Basically a simplified self hosted version of your own imdb of your own movie collection.

Requirements:
- a running webserver Apache/Nginx/HTTPD/IIS
- PHP 7.x
- Mysql/Mariadb
